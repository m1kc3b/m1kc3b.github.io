Whether you’re building stunning visualizations, dynamic gaming experiences, or generative art, WebGL and Three.js provide the foundation to bring your creations to life. However, like any technology, they come with their limitations, particularly when it comes to performance.</p><p data-v-befd8acc>That’s where WebAssembly (Wasm) steps in. WebAssembly is a binary instruction format that allows developers to write code in languages like C, C++, and Rust, then run it in the browser at near-native speeds.
